    description: "Swirling ectoplasm, crimson and black and lit from within by crackles of sickly yellow energy, takes on a rough humanoid shape, but the angargeist is clearly nothing alive.  Where a face ought to be is a molten ruin, lopsided eyes of unholy flame sparking in its ill-made sockets.  Immaterial and dripping essence, the arms and legs are uneven, both ending in straining talons.  The angargeist's form bubbles and simmers in places like fury lent form.",

    sympathy: "Quivering with rage, a roiling crimson angargeist sends dripping tendrils of rust-colored ectoplasm toward you!\nThe dull golden nimbus surrounding you flares into life as it glows brightly for a moment.\nCS: +489 - TD: +353 + CvA: -27 + d100: +20 - +5 == +124\nWarding failed!\nRage, boiling and hot, bubbles up within your chest as you feel overwhelmed with sympathy for the angargeist!"
